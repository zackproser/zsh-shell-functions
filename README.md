# ZSH Shell functions

This repository will hold some helpful ZSH shell functions / utilities that I am putting together. 

I plan to eventually blog about these and provide a tutorial and demos of their use.

# Functionality 

* `autogit` - These scripts work together to ensure you are always looking at the latest code whenever you change directories into a new local repository. It handles git fetching, pruning remote branches, stashing local changes if your worktree is dirty, etc. It's also beautiful thanks to Charmbracelet's gum library!
